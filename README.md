#### VSCode with the following extensions:
   - Odoo IDE
   - Owl Vision
   - Odoo Shortcuts

#### Setup Steps

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teguhteja/docker-odoo-dev.git -b 15
readme.excalidraw
readme.plantuml
.gitignore
.dockerignore
pyenv install 3.9.18
pyenv versions
pyenv local 3.9.18 # .python-version
# direnv, echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'layout pyenv 3.9.18' > .envrc
direnv allow
source .direnv/python-3.9.18/bin/activate
# THIS doesnt need if .envrc/direnv is used
# python -m venv .venv 
# source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
touch .env
GH action https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release
GH readme.md https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template

```

**Odoo Framework Integration for Visual Studio Code**
```bash
https://github.com/odoo-ide/vscode-odoo

```

**Python static analysis tool : Odoo Stubs**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/odoo-ide/odoo-stubs.git -b 15.0 odoo-stubs-15
```
pyrightconfig.json
```bash
{
    "stubPath": "./odoo-stubs15/",
    "extraPaths": [
        "./custom-addons/",
    ]
}
```

**Build Docker Image w/ pydevd-odoo debugger**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/odoo-ide/pydevd-odoo
   requirements.txt pydevd-odoo
   in Dockerfile
   - change image sourceand version based on which paltform you are developing
      arm macos -->FROM wbms/odoo-15.0
      arm macos -->FROM arm64v8/odoo:15.0
      x86 --> FROM odoo:15
   docker build --platform linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t odoodev:15 .
   ```

**Start Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   in docker-compose.yml
   - change version related parameters 
   --> platform: linux/amd64
   docker compose up -d
   ```

**Add Your Addons**
   `mkdir custom-addons`
   `docker compose restart odoo-dev`

**Debugging**
   - Set breakpoints in your source code within VSCode.
   - Ensure the debugger is configured to debug external code (`"justMyCode": false` in .vscode/launch.json).
   - Access the Odoo source code from the container:
     ```bash
     ./docker-cp-odoo.sh
     ```
   - Add breakpoints in the Odoo source code.
   - Run the debugger process to start debugging.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

**Copying misc.py in odoodev**
   If backup failures occur with Docker images, modify `misc.py` to resolve issues.

**Debugging Odoo Source Code**
   Modify `"justMyCode": false` in `launch.json`, 
   download the Odoo folder from the container using `docker-cp-odoo.sh`,
   uncomment this line in docker-compose.yml
   `- ./odoo:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo` 
   restart stack or docker compose
   add breakpoints, and start the debugger process .

#### Conclusion
This README provides detailed steps to set up an Odoo development environment using Docker and VSCode, enabling efficient debugging of Odoo applications. For further details, refer to the full documentation and scripts available in the project repository.
